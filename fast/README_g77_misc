Use useful_tools/compile_misc.csh to compile all programs with g77.  Binaries will 
be output in the directory ../bin.

Note:  Take special care to set the values correctly for you modelling / inversion
runs ray.par, and to increase nnzmax and ndmax in inverse.f / inverse_2d.f as needed
before compiling.
