Congratulations!  You have unpacked the FAST g77 patch!  

If they're not there already, copy all of these files and subdirectories into
the directory containing the un-tarred fast.tar available from Colin Zelt at 
Rice University :
        cp -Rf * ../fast/

To apply the patch use the following command :
	patch -p0 < fast_g77.diff

The script useful_tools/make_diff.csh was used to compare all files in the subdirectories
of the fast.tar file with my files edited for compilation with g77 due to syntactic differences
between the Solaris and GNU FORTRAN compilers.  The output is fast_g77.diff.

The binaries can be compiled manualy or with the COMPILE_FAST.csh script :
	./COMPILE_FAST.csh
