All the 3D examples were performed using the old version of the program
inverse (now called inverse_old.f). To replicate the results of the
3D example you must use this old version. However, this old version of
inverse.f was missing the smoothness constraints around the edges of
the model (that is why the results are so bad when sedge=0, like
those presented for the 3D example in the directory "final5"). 
The new program "inverse.f" should be used in all work now (except to
replicate the results of the examples provided). Also, in general,
you should be able to reduce or even remove the edge constraints
(sedge=0) and get the best results.
