ttmin - a time is replaced if it is decreased by at least this much
tthwmin - decreased time when counting head wave operators used 
          must be at least this much
hwmin - as a percentage of total model nodes, there must be at 
        least this many times replaced for another reversal to happen
trmin - the maximum time decreased must be greater than this for 
        another reversal to happen
